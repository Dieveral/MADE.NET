## Contributing

Before contributing, the components below are required in order to build and run the project. For more information on contributing, see our guidelines [here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Visual Studio (Windows/Mac)

Visual Studio is required for developing MADE App Components. 

It is recommended on Windows to use the latest Visual Studio 2017 release which you can download [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). 

A Community edition of Visual Studio is available and is 100% free to use for this open source project.

As part of the Visual Studio 2017 installation, you will require the Universal Windows Platform development (Fall Creators Update SDK), .NET desktop development and Mobile development with .NET (Xamarin) workflows installed.

For Mac, the Visual Studio for Mac installation will provide most of the components required for developing MADE App Components.

#### Android SDK (Windows/Mac)
The Android SDKs should be installed as part of the Visual Studio installation, however, it is always important to check for updates and have the latest SDKs and build tools available. 

#### XCode (Mac)
As well as Visual Studio for Mac, to develop components for iOS, the latest version of XCode is required to be installed on your Mac.
